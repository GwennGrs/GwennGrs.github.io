description: As part of the Data Structures and Algorithms course at the University of Helsinki, I had the opportunity to build a multilayer perceptron model from scratch for prediction on the famous “Titanic” dataset. This project allowed me to work on the mathematical formulas behind this type of algorithm (gradient descent, fastforward, sigmoid).
