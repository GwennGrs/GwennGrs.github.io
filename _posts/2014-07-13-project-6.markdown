description: Development of a Trojan horse as part of a university project. I used GTK and C to build a functional media player that secretly duplicates .jpg, .png, and .webp files in the background. Created for the Network and Security course, this project highlights vulnerabilities associated with unverified open-source software and the risks of user negligence.
