description: As part of my final year in a Bachelor of Computer Science at La Rochelle University, I completed a six-week professional internship at Mementa, a company focused on preserving memory-related heritage. My primary mission involved technical research and expertise for the development of "Ma Mémothèque," a web application designed to digitize and value family history through the recognition of handwritten archives. I specialized in Handwritten Text Recognition (HTR), moving beyond standard OCR to address the complexities of historical manuscripts such as old letters, wills, and postcards. To achieve this, I implemented and tested various solutions including Tesseract and Kraken, ultimately focusing on fine-tuning deep learning models to improve transcription accuracy for specific French handwriting styles. During the project I managed the entire data pipeline, from preprocessing the images using OpenCv to performing document segmentation.
