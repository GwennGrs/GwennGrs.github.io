description: As part of a database course, we simulated a realistic and non-academic client request. The project consisted of retrieving different datasets (Oscars and movies), cleaning them, modeling a coherent and practical schema, and then implementing the database. The choices made during modeling and creation aimed to ensure data persistence, security, and consistency between the datasets and the information we wanted to extract. Once the database was created, our model being flexible, it allowed the integration of other datasets after a preprocessing phase.
